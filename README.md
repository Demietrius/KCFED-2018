UCMO Mules One – Don’t Make Me Think

Getting off work, studying for class, or taking care of kids, no matter what you are doing, the weekend helps balance your life.
That little bit of relaxation and fun, that is, if you didn’t have to find the perfect meals for the next week and make a grocery list.


With our new app, TasteBud, we make it so easy you don’t even have to think.  Using a simple, streamlined interface, TaseBud will plan your meals pulling from an extensive library that tailors to your personal tastes and preferences. Whether you’re lactose intolerant, gluten free, or just incredibly picky, we have the solution that fits your needs – and once we auto-generate your shopping list the only thing you need to do is go to the store.
